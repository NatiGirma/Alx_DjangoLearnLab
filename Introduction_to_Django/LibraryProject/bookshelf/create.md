# Create Operation for Book Model

```python
from bookshelf.models import Book

# Create a new Book instance
book = Book(title="1984", author="George Orwell", publication_year=1949)
book.save()
# Expected output: Book instance created successfully and saved to database

Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).

✅ Now the file `LibraryProject/bookshelf/create.md` exists and contains the create command.

You’ll need to do the **same for**:  
- `retrieve.md`  
- `update.md`  
- `delete.md`
